# GlassSphere reading — backtest

Gate BTC_USDT perpetual, 1H, 161 days evaluated every 4h after a 400-bar warm-up (2026-05-13 → 2026-10-21). Train = first 120 days of data, test = the rest (620 / 348 points). Forward return over 24h. Overlapping windows: the t-stat uses n / 6 effective points.

The order book factor is not tested (no free order book history).

## 1. Liquidation model against real liquidations

Hourly correlation of the USD the model liquidates when price sweeps its levels with Gate's real liquidations (Gate OI only, so the level is not comparable, only the timing).

| Variant | Longs | Shorts | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| candle split, mix 10/25/50/100× = 35/30/20/15% | 0.66 | 0.79 | 0.72 |
| candle + taker split, same mix | 0.68 | 0.79 | 0.73 |
| candle + taker split, low leverage (5/10/25/50× = 30/35/25/10%) **(used)** | 0.72 | 0.82 | 0.78 |
| candle + taker split, high leverage (25/50/100× = 40/35/25%) | 0.62 | 0.65 | 0.61 |

## 3. Which pool is hit first

At each point: the largest stop + liquidation pool above and below the price within one average day's range. Which is reached first within 24h?

| Part | Points with a hit | Pull side first | Closer side first | When they disagree: pull side wins |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| train | 354 | 63% | 69% | 45/110 = 41% |
| test | 185 | 56% | 65% | 18/54 = 33% |
| all | 539 | 61% | 68% | 63/164 = 38% |

A random walk without drift reaches the upper of two levels first with probability (distance to lower) / (sum of distances). Does that hold for these pools?

| Predicted P(up first) | Points | Actually up first |
|---|---|---|
| 0%–20% (mean 14%) | 9 | 0% |
| 20%–40% (mean 32%) | 108 | 28% |
| 40%–60% (mean 50%) | 228 | 45% |
| 60%–80% (mean 69%) | 154 | 71% |
| 80%–100% (mean 86%) | 40 | 92% |

Brier score 0.208 (0.25 = coin flip). Neither pool reached within 24h: 429 of 968 points.

## 5. Which chance comes true: the 3-day reading by the chance shown, 17 coins

scripts/glasssphere_threshold_test.py: the page's 3-day reading (targets at least 0.3 × the expected range away) on the Binance archive, 2022 (or the listing) – Sep 2026, every 6 hours, for BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE, SUI, ENA, 1000PEPE, WLD, NEAR, HYPE, ZEC, LTC, ADA, UNI and LINK. *Came true*: the more likely target was reached first, of the times one was reached within 3 days. *Trade*: toward it, stop at the other target, closed after 3 days if neither; 0.1% round-trip cost. All coins pooled, weighted by points.

| Chance shown | Points | Mean shown | Came true | Neither in 3 days | Target / stop (median) | Avg trade after cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50-54% | 31797 | 52% | 54% | 44% | 7.5% / 8.2% | -0.03% |
| 55-59% | 27814 | 57% | 60% | 40% | 6.2% / 8.3% | -0.14% |
| 60-64% | 20492 | 62% | 68% | 37% | 5.1% / 8.4% | -0.07% |
| 65-69% | 13683 | 67% | 74% | 33% | 4.3% / 8.6% | -0.05% |
| 70-74% | 7240 | 72% | 79% | 30% | 3.6% / 9.0% | -0.12% |
| 75-79% | 912 | 75% | 86% | 29% | 3.1% / 9.6% | -0.03% |

| From | Points | Mean shown | Came true | Neither | Avg trade after cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 55% | 70141 | 62% | 68% | 37% | -0.10% |
| 60% | 42327 | 65% | 73% | 34% | -0.07% |
| 65% | 21835 | 69% | 76% | 32% | -0.07% |
| 70% | 8152 | 72% | 80% | 30% | -0.11% |
| 75% | 912 | 75% | 86% | 29% | -0.03% |

Per coin, from 65% (the buy / sell signal):

| Coin | Points | Came true | Avg trade after cost | t |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BTCUSDT | 1657 | 74% | -0.33% | -1.2 |
| ETHUSDT | 1555 | 76% | -0.24% | -0.6 |
| SOLUSDT | 1459 | 79% | +0.11% | +0.2 |
| BNBUSDT | 1707 | 77% | -0.22% | -0.7 |
| XRPUSDT | 1419 | 74% | -0.27% | -0.6 |
| DOGEUSDT | 1541 | 77% | +0.02% | +0.0 |
| SUIUSDT | 1093 | 76% | +0.01% | +0.0 |
| ENAUSDT | 517 | 78% | +0.80% | +0.8 |
| 1000PEPEUSDT | 866 | 74% | -0.05% | -0.1 |
| WLDUSDT | 742 | 72% | -0.47% | -0.5 |
| NEARUSDT | 1331 | 78% | +0.24% | +0.4 |
| HYPEUSDT | 424 | 80% | +0.27% | +0.3 |
| ZECUSDT | 1331 | 72% | -0.62% | -1.1 |
| LTCUSDT | 1556 | 78% | -0.04% | -0.1 |
| ADAUSDT | 1507 | 79% | +0.02% | +0.0 |
| UNIUSDT | 1501 | 78% | -0.01% | -0.0 |
| LINKUSDT | 1629 | 78% | +0.23% | +0.5 |

The chance shown is conservative: what is shown as 65–69% came true 75% of the time, 75%+ 86%. But the higher the chance, the nearer the target and the farther the stop, so a trade toward it stays near zero after cost at every level, and no coin's result is far from noise (|t| ≤ 1.2). No minimum chance turns the reading into a profitable signal on its own.

### Other stops: take profit at the more likely target, stop at a multiple of its distance

Instead of the stop at the other target: the stop at 0.5, 0.75, 1 or 1.5 × the distance to the target (a candle touching both counts as the stop; closed after 3 days if neither; 0.1% round-trip cost). Avg trade after cost (share of winning trades), all coins pooled.

| From | Points | Stop at the other target | Stop 0.5× | Stop 0.75× | Stop 1× | Stop 1.5× |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 55% | 70141 | -0.10% | -0.10% (36%) | -0.09% (44%) | -0.09% (50%) | -0.10% (54%) |
| 60% | 42327 | -0.07% | -0.07% (35%) | -0.07% (44%) | -0.07% (50%) | -0.07% (55%) |
| 65% | 21835 | -0.07% | -0.04% (35%) | -0.04% (44%) | -0.04% (50%) | -0.06% (56%) |
| 70% | 8152 | -0.11% | -0.04% (35%) | -0.04% (44%) | -0.05% (50%) | -0.06% (57%) |

From 65%, coins with a positive result: stop 0.5× 6 of 17, stop 0.75× 7 of 17, stop 1.0× 8 of 17, stop 1.5× 9 of 17; the largest |t| is 1.9 (BTC, losing).

With the stop as far as the target the trade wins half the time: the reading picks the nearer pool, which the price reaches first more often because it is nearer, not because the reading foresees the direction. No stop makes it pay after cost.

### The 1-day reading against the 3-day reading

The same test with the 1-day reading (`--days 1`: targets within one day's expected range, judged after 1 day). All coins pooled.

| From | Reading | Points | Came true | Neither | Target / stop (median, mean of coins) | Trade after cost | Stop 1× (wins) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 60% | 1 day | 41895 | 73% | 42% | 2.8% / 5.5% | -0.10% | -0.12% (49%) |
| 60% | 3 days | 42327 | 73% | 34% | 4.4% / 8.6% | -0.07% | -0.07% (50%) |
| 65% | 1 day | 21822 | 78% | 38% | 2.6% / 5.7% | -0.08% | -0.10% (49%) |
| 65% | 3 days | 21835 | 76% | 32% | 3.9% / 8.8% | -0.07% | -0.04% (50%) |
| 70% | 1 day | 8170 | 82% | 35% | 2.3% / 6.0% | -0.07% | -0.11% (49%) |
| 70% | 3 days | 8152 | 80% | 30% | 3.5% / 9.1% | -0.11% | -0.05% (50%) |

From 65%, coins with a positive trade: 4 of 17 on 1 day, 8 of 17 on 3 days. The 1-day reading comes true about as often (a little more at the top), but its targets are smaller and more often neither is reached in time; after cost it does no better.

### Where the result goes, and your own take profit and stop

From 65%, 3 days, all coins (21835 points). With the take profit at the more likely target and the stop at the other one:

| Outcome | Share | Mean result | Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target reached (take profit) | 52% | +3.89% | +2.04% |
| Other target reached (stop) | 16% | -8.71% | -1.40% |
| Neither within 3 days (closed) | 32% | -2.22% | -0.70% |
| **Total after cost** | | | **-0.07%** |

Own take profit and stop as multiples of the distance to the more likely target (closed after 3 days if neither):

| Take profit | Stop | Take profit hit | Stop hit | Closed at 3 days | Avg trade after cost | Coins positive |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5× | 0.5× | 50% | 49% | 0% | -0.07% | 4 of 17 |
| 0.5× | 1.0× | 66% | 31% | 3% | -0.06% | 6 of 17 |
| 0.5× | 1.5× | 71% | 21% | 8% | -0.07% | 7 of 17 |
| 0.5× | 2.0× | 73% | 14% | 13% | -0.07% | 7 of 17 |
| 0.75× | 0.5× | 40% | 59% | 1% | -0.06% | 6 of 17 |
| 0.75× | 1.0× | 54% | 39% | 7% | -0.07% | 8 of 17 |
| 0.75× | 1.5× | 59% | 26% | 14% | -0.08% | 8 of 17 |
| 0.75× | 2.0× | 62% | 17% | 21% | -0.08% | 8 of 17 |
| 1.0× | 0.5× | 33% | 64% | 3% | -0.04% | 6 of 17 |
| 1.0× | 1.0× | 45% | 44% | 11% | -0.04% | 8 of 17 |
| 1.0× | 1.5× | 50% | 29% | 21% | -0.06% | 9 of 17 |
| 1.0× | 2.0× | 52% | 19% | 29% | -0.05% | 10 of 17 |

Every combination lands between −0.04% and −0.08% after 0.1% cost: the share of winners follows the break-even rate stop ÷ (take profit + stop) set by the distances. The chance is (price − lower target) ÷ (upper − lower target), what a random walk gives, so the levels alone carry no edge; a filter the reading does not have (trend, entry, funding) would be needed.

### Levels as take profit and stop

The take profit at (1×) or just before (0.9×) the target cluster, the stop 0.2% beyond the nearest strong stop / liquidation cluster on the other side (pool weight at least 0.3, 0.6 or 1.0 of a maximum of 2, at least 0.15 × the expected range away). Order book walls cannot be tested: the archive has no order books.

| From | Take profit | Stop behind cluster ≥ | Stop (median) | Take profit hit | Stop hit | Closed at 3 days | Avg trade after cost | Coins positive |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 55% | 0.9× | 0.3 | 3.9% | 40% | 45% | 15% | -0.10% | 3 of 17 |
| 55% | 0.9× | 0.6 | 6.1% | 43% | 33% | 23% | -0.10% | 3 of 17 |
| 55% | 0.9× | 1.0 | 8.8% | 46% | 22% | 32% | -0.12% | 2 of 17 |
| 55% | 1.0× | 0.3 | 3.9% | 37% | 46% | 17% | -0.09% | 4 of 17 |
| 55% | 1.0× | 0.6 | 6.1% | 40% | 34% | 26% | -0.08% | 4 of 17 |
| 55% | 1.0× | 1.0 | 8.8% | 42% | 22% | 35% | -0.11% | 3 of 17 |
| 65% | 0.9× | 0.3 | 3.9% | 47% | 41% | 12% | -0.06% | 8 of 17 |
| 65% | 0.9× | 0.6 | 6.4% | 51% | 29% | 20% | -0.06% | 8 of 17 |
| 65% | 0.9× | 1.0 | 9.3% | 54% | 18% | 28% | -0.10% | 6 of 17 |
| 65% | 1.0× | 0.3 | 3.9% | 45% | 42% | 13% | -0.04% | 8 of 17 |
| 65% | 1.0× | 0.6 | 6.4% | 48% | 30% | 22% | -0.03% | 9 of 17 |
| 65% | 1.0× | 1.0 | 9.3% | 51% | 18% | 31% | -0.08% | 8 of 17 |

Between −0.03% and −0.12% after cost: placing the take profit and stop at the clusters does no better than fixed multiples. A take profit just before the cluster is slightly worse than at it.

## 6. Beyond the distances: what else tells the direction (1-day reading, 17 coins)

`scripts/glasssphere_edge_test.py`, Binance archive 2022 (or the listing) – Sep 2026, every 6 hours, 102,148 points.
Each feature is fitted on 2022 – 2024 as a tilt on the distance chance (logistic, the distance chance as offset) and
judged on 2025 – Sep 2026. Log loss: of the times a target was reached within the day (distance alone 0.6367).

| feature | weight | log loss 2025–26 | trade toward it (edge ≥ 5%, 0.1% cost) |
|---|---|---|---|
| net taker buying 24h (flow) | +0.60 | −0.0035 | +0.10%, t +1.3 |
| trend (price vs 7-day average) | +0.24 | −0.0025 | −0.12%, t −1.3 |
| size of the target pools | +0.14 | −0.0011 | +0.08%, t +0.9 |
| open interest change with the move | +0.09 | −0.0001 | no trades |
| funding | −0.12 | +0.0003 | no trades |
| all five | | −0.0042 | −0.02%, t −0.3 |

Flow is the only one that holds: fitted on each year alone its weight is +0.61, +0.66, +0.58, +0.78, +0.52 (2022 – 2026),
and fitted on the years before it improved every later year (2024, 2025, 2026). Adding the pool size or the trend to it
barely changes the log loss and makes the trades no better. Simple rules on a band of ±0.5 × the expected range, 2025 – 26:
with the trend −0.13% (t −4.1), rising OI with the move −0.15%, against crowded funding −0.14%, with net buying −0.02%.

**Expected range.** It already comes from the average daily range of the last 14 days. From 7 or 3 days instead: log
loss the same (7) or worse (3), the reading at 70%+ −0.08% → +0.02% / 0.00% per trade, within the noise. Kept at 14.

**The chance shown, calibrated.** P(up first) = σ(a · logit(distance chance) + b · tanh(flow / 10%)), fitted on all years:

| horizon | a | b | neither target reached |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 day | 1.561 | 0.428 | 48% |
| 3 days | 1.486 | 0.421 | 39% |
| 1 week | 1.411 | 0.333 | 26% |

Fitted on 2022 – 2024 alone, 2025 – 26 (1 day): shown 55% came true 55%, 62% 62%, 67% 68%, 72% 71%, 77% 78%, 82% 81%,
86% 88%; 3 days and a week within 3 points. The distance chance alone at 60% is about 65% calibrated, at 70% about 79%:
the page shows Neutraal below 65% and Buy / Sell from 80% (the same strength as 70% before). Out of sample, 1 day:
distance ≥ 70% 3,082 signals, came true 82%, −0.14% per trade; calibrated ≥ 80% 2,878, 82%, −0.10%.

**Costs.** With limit (maker) orders in and out, about 0.04% round trip instead of 0.10%: every result above is 0.06%
better. The calibrated signals at 80% are then −0.04% per trade, flow trades +0.16% (t +2.1, 10 of 17 coins positive):
not enough to rely on.

**Order book imbalance** has no history to test on; the data files now keep the depth within 0.5% and 1% each hour
(`bookImb`, 2000 hours) so it can be tested later.

## 7. BTC as a guide, the weekday, and the liquidation model on 17 coins

**BTC as a guide for the other coins** (16 coins, the 1-day reading, BTC's point at the same hour). On top of the coin's
own calibrated chance, fitted on 2022 – 2024: BTC's net taker buying weight +0.30, log loss 2025 – 26 −0.0016; BTC's
reading +0.05 (−0.0003), BTC's 24h move +0.01 (−0.0002). BTC's buying is not stable: fitted per year +0.29, +0.30,
+0.39, +0.91, −0.05 (2022 – 2026), and walking forward it made 2026 worse (0.6323 → 0.6347). Not used.

**Weekday and hour** (all 17 coins, all years). How often neither target was reached, by the weekday the horizon starts:

| horizon | Mo | Tu | We | Th | Fr | Sa | Su |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 day | 44% | 46% | 42% | 45% | 52% | 66% | 45% |
| 3 days | 35% | 35% | 36% | 44% | 44% | 42% | 36% |
| 1 week | 26% | 26% | 26% | 26% | 26% | 27% | 27% |

The chance came true about as shown on every day (Saturday a little more: 65% shown, 69% came true) and at every hour
(00, 06, 12, 18 UTC: 64.5 – 65.8% for 64.6 – 64.9% shown; neither 48 – 49%). The page shows the neither share of the day.

**Liquidation model against Gate's real liquidations**, 17 coins, Gate's own open interest, taker share and candles,
the last 4000 hours. Hourly correlation of the USD the model liquidates with the real liquidations (mean over the coins):

| leverage mix | longs | shorts | total | best on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5/10/25/50× = 30/35/25/10% **(used)** | 0.61 | 0.53 | 0.53 | 5 coins |
| 3/5/10/25× = 25/35/30/10% | 0.58 | 0.53 | 0.49 | 3 |
| 5/10/20× = 35/40/25% | 0.59 | 0.53 | 0.51 | 1 |
| 10/20/50/100× = 35/35/20/10% | 0.60 | 0.49 | 0.51 | 6 |
| 10× only | 0.45 | 0.46 | 0.42 | 1 |
| 20× only | 0.50 | 0.40 | 0.43 | 1 |

BTC 0.78, ETH 0.80, the smaller coins (thin liquidations on Gate) 0.24 – 0.65. The mix in use stays.
